## The Ruby Changes

This site is dedicate to history of [Ruby language](http://ruby-lang.org/) evolution. Basically, it is just the same information that each Ruby version's [NEWS](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/NEWS) file contains, just in more readable and informative manner.

Main goals:

* **Full**: unlike most of "What's new in Ruby 2.6?" blog posts, information here targets to cover all the `NEWS` file of current Ruby version;
* **Comprehensive**: unlike the `NEWS` file itself (and most of blog-posts, too), the site provides full context for each change:
  * Where and how it was dicussed;
  * Related documentation at ruby-doc.org;
  * Code examples;
  * Reasoning for the change, if known.
* **Concise**: given two goals above, content still tries to stay short and focused, so the changes could be quickly navigated through;
* **Well-structured**: both regarding order/explanations of each particular change, and design of the site, it is intended to be easily and logically navigated.

Some things to know about the content:

* Structure and grouping of the information, as well as the illustrative examples, are mostly decided on this site's [author](https://github.com/zverok). I am trying to make it as useful and logical as humanly possible, but I have my own opinions about what is important, and what is not, what is related and what is not.
* The site is dedicated to the **language**, not its **implementation(s)**, therefore at the moment it **does not** include the description of MRI implementation changes, optimizations and internals;
* ...and also some minor _behavior_ changes are excluded.
* I want to _eventually_ cover Ruby versions down to 1.8, or maybe even earlier, but it is currently work-in-progress, with the first priority of the recent release of Ruby 2.6, and then going down version by version in my free time.
