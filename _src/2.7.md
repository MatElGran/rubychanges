# Ruby 2.7

* **Released at:** Dec 25, 2019 ([NEWS](TODO) file)
* **Status (as of <<date>>):** TODO
* **This document first published:** TODO
* **Last change to this document:** <<date>>

## Highlights

Ruby 2.7 is a last big release before 3.0


## Language

### Pattern matching

### Keyword argument-related changes

Ruby 2.7 introduced a lot of changes towards more consistent keyword arguments processing. Fortunately, examples, justifications and relationships of those changes, as well as links to docs and discussions are published on [official site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/).

Therefore here we'll just list the changes for the sake of completeness of this changelog:

* Warnings (would be errors in 3.0) for implicit coversion of the last argument-hash to keyword arguments, and vice versa;
* `Module#ruby2_keywords` method to mark method as not warning when the last argument is used as keyword one (to provide backward- and forward-compatible way of defining "delegating all" methods);
* "Forward all arguments" syntax: `(...)`
* Non-`Symbol` keys are allowed in keyword arguments unpacking;
* `**nil` syntax in method definition to explicitly mark method that doesn't accept keywords (and can't be called with a hash without curly braces);
* empty hash splat doesn't pass empty hash as a positional argument.

### Numbered block parameters

In block without explicitly specified parameters, variables `_1` through `_9` can be used to reference parameters.

* **Reason:** It is one of the approaches to make short blocks DRY-er and easier to read. E.g. in `filenames.each { |f| File.read(f) }`, repetition of `f` and extra syntax needed for it can be considered an unnecessary verbosity, so `each { File.read(_1) }` could be now used instead.
* **Discussion:** _The feature was discussed for a long time, syntax and semantics was changed several times on the road to 2.7_ [Feature #4475](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4475) (initial discussion, started 9 years ago and finished with accepting of `@0`-`@9`), [Misc #15723](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15723) (change to `_0`-`_9`), [Feature #16178](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16178) (dropping of `_0` and changing semantics of `_1`)
* **Documentation:** []()
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Simplest usage:
  [10, 20, 30].map { _1**2 }
  # => [100, 400, 900]

  # Multiple block parameters can be accessed as subsequent numbers
  [10, 20, 30].zip([40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]).map { _1 + _2 + _3 }
  # => [120, 150, 180]

  # If only _1 is used for multi-argument block, it contains all arguments
  [10, 20, 30].zip([40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]).map { _1.join(',') }
  # => ["10,40,70", "20,50,80", "30,60,90"]

  # If the block has explicit parameters, numbered one is SyntaxError
  [10, 20, 30].map { |x| _1**2 }
  # SyntaxError ((irb):1: ordinary parameter is defined)

  # Outside the block, usage is warned:
  _1 = 'test'
  # warning: `_1' is reserved as numbered parameter

  # But after that, _1 references local variable:
  [10].each { p _1 }
  # prints "test"

  # Numbered parameters are reflected in Proc's parameters and arity
  p = proc { _1 + _2 }
  l = lambda { _1 + _2 }
  p.parameters
  # => [[:opt, :_1], [:opt, :_2]]
  p.arity
  # => 2
  l.parameters
  # => [[:req, :_1], [:req, :_2]]
  l.arity
  # => 2

  # Nested blocks with numbered parameters are not allowed:
  %w[test me].each { _1.each_char { p _1 } }
  # SyntaxError (numbered parameter is already used in outer block here)
  # %w[test me].each { _1.each_char { p _1 } }
  #                    ^~
  ```

### Beginless range

In addition to endless range in Ruby 2.6 `(start..)`, Ruby 2.7 introduces beginless one: `(..end)`.

* **Reason:** Array slicing (initial justification for endless ranges) turned out to be not the only usage for semi-open ranges. Another ones, like `case`/`grep`, DSLs and constants and [`Comparable#clamp`](TODO), can gain from the symmetricity of "range without end"/"range without beginning".
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14799](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14799)
* **Documentation:** [doc/syntax/literals.rdoc#Ranges](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Ranges)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Usage examples
  %w[a b c][..1] # same as [0..1], not really useful

  case creation_time
  when ...1.year.ago then 'ancient'
  when 1.year.ago...1.month.ago then 'old'
  when 1.month.ago...1.day.ago then 'recent'
  when 1.day.ago... then 'new'
  end

  users.map(&:age).any?(...18)

  # Properties:
  r = ..10
  r.begin # => nil
  r.count # TypeError (can't iterate from NilClass), same with any other Enumerable methods
  r.size  # => Infinity
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Slightly "a-grammatic" name ("beginless" instead of "beginningless") is due to the fact that it is a range literally lacking `begin` property.
  * Unfortunately, parser can not always handle beginless range without the help of the parenthises:
  ```ruby
  (1..10).grep ..5
  # ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1))
  # ...because it is in fact parsed as ((1..10).grep()..5), e.g. range from grep results to 5
  ```
  This may seem an esotheric problem, but it becomes less esotheric in DSLs. For example in RubySpec, one would like to write:
  ```ruby
  ruby_version ..'1.9' do
    # some tests for old Ruby
  end
  ```
  ...but the only way is
  ```ruby
  ruby_version(..'1.9') do
    # some tests for old Ruby
  end
  ```

### Syntax changes

* Comments between `.foo` calls are now allowed:
  ```ruby
  (1..20).select(&:odd?)
         # This was not possible in 2.6
         .map { |x| x**2 }
  # => [1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, 289, 361]
  ```
* Quotes (if exist) in HERE-documents should be on the same line as document start:
  ```ruby
   <<"EOS
   " # This had been warned since 2.4; Now it raises a SyntaxError
   EOS
   ```
* Modifier `rescue` parsing change (multiple assignement now consisent with singular):

  ```ruby
  a = raise rescue 1
  # => 1
  a # => 1 in Ruby 2.6 and 2.7

  a, b = raise rescue [1, 2]
  # => [1, 2]

  # 2.6
  a # => nil
  b # => nil
  # The statement parsed as: (a, b = raise) rescue [1, 2]

  # 2.7
  a # => 1
  b # => 2
  # The statement parsed as: a, b = (raise rescue [1, 2])
  ```

### Warnings/deprecations

Some older or accidental features are deprecated on the road to 3.0 and currently produce warnings.

* `yield` in singleton class syntax (was inconsistent with local variables accessibility). Discussion: [Feature #15575](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15575).
  ```ruby
  def foo
    x = 1
    class << Object.new
      p x   # ArgumentError (undefined local variable or method) -- enclosing scope NOT accessible
      yield # calls block passed to foo, implying enclosing scope IS accessible
      # In Ruby 2.7: warning: `yield' in class syntax will not be supported from Ruby 3.0.
    end
  end
  foo { p :ok }
  ```
* `$;` and `$,` global variables (Perl ancestry: default `split` and `join` separators):
  ```ruby
  $; = '???'
  # warning: non-nil $; will be deprecated
  'foo???bar'.split
  # warning: $; is set to non-nil value
  # => ["foo", "bar"]

  $, = '###'
  # warning: non-nil $, will be deprecated
  %w[foo bar].join
  # warning: $, is set to non-nil value
  "foo###bar"
  ```
* Contrastingly, the flip-flop syntax deprecation, [introduced](#TODO) in 2.6, **is reverted**. It turned out that for brevity in text-processing scrips (including one-liners run as `ruby -e "print <something>"`) the feature, however esotheric it may seem, has a justified usage.
  * **Discussion:** [Feature #5400](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400#note-23).
  * **Documentation:** [doc/syntax/control_expressions.rdoc#Flip-Flop](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-Flip-Flop)
  * **Code:**
    ```ruby
    # Imagine we are working with some data file where real data starts with "<<<"" line and end with ">>>>"
    File.each_line('data.txt', chomp: true).filter_map { |ln| ln if ln == '<<<'..ln == '>>>' }
    # => gets lines starting from <<<, and ending with >>>.
    #   The condition "flips on" when the first part is true, and then "flips off" when the second is true

    # Flip-flop-less version would be something like this (with the differenc it ignores last >>>):
    lines.drop_while { |ln| ln != '<<<' }.take_while { |ln| ln != '>>>' }
    ```

#### "Safe" and "taint" concepts are deprecated in general

The concepts of marking objects as ["tainted"](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/Object.html#method-i-taint) (unsafe, came from the outside) and "untaint" them after the check, is for a long time ignored by most of the libraries. `$SAFE` constant, trying to limit "unsafe" calls when set to higher values, is considered a fundamentally flawed method and [documented so since Ruby 2.0](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/doc/security_rdoc.html#label-24SAFE). At the same time, as the "official" security features, subtle bugs in implementation of `$SAFE` and tainting have caused lot of "vulnerability reports" and added maintenance burden.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #16131](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16131)

### `self.<private_method>`

Calling a private method with a literal `self` as the receiver is now allowed.

* **Reason:** "`anything.method` is always disallowed for private methods" seemed like a simple and unambiguous rule, but produced some ugly edge cases (for example, `self.foo = something` for private `attr_accessor` _was_ allowed). It turned out "allow literal `self.`" makes things much clearer.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #11297](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11297), [Feature #16123](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16123)
* **Documentation:** []()
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class A
    def update
      self.a = 42 # works even in Ruby 2.6, because there was no other way to call private setter
      self.a += 42 # "private method `a' called" in 2.6, works in 2.7

      self + 42 # "private method `+' called" in 2.6, works in 2.7

      x = self
      x.a = 42 # "private method `a=' called" even in 2.7, not a literal self
    end

    private

    attr_accessor :a

    def +(other)
      puts "+ called"
    end
  end
  ```

## Core classes and modules

### Better `Method#inspect`

`Method#inspect` now shows method's arguments and source location (if available).

* **Reason:** As there are more code style approaches that operate `Method` objects, making them better identifiable and informative seemed necessary.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14145](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14145)
* **Documentation:** [Method#inspect](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Method.html#method-i-inspect)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  p CSV.method(:read)
  # Ruby 2.6:
  #   => #<Method: CSV.read>
  # Ruby 2.7:
  #   => #<Method: CSV.read(path, **options) <...>/lib/ruby/2.7.0/csv.rb:714>

  # For methods defined in C, path and param names aren't available, but at least generic signature is:
  [].method(:at)
  # => #<Method: Array#at(_)>

  # Convention: unknown param name is displayed as _, param has default value -- as ...
  def m(a, b=nil, *c, d:, e: nil, **rest, &block)
  end

  p method(:m)
  #=> #<Method: m(a, b=..., *c, d:, e: ..., **rest, &block) ...skip...>
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * while enhancing `Method#inspect`, `Proc`'s string representation also changed for consistency: now object id separated from location by ` ` (for easier copy-pasting). Discussion: [Feature #16101](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16101)
  ```ruby
  p(proc {})
  # Ruby 2.6:
  #   => #<Proc:0x000055e4d93f2708@(irb):13>
  # Ruby 2.7:
  #   => #<Proc:0x000055e4d93f2708 (irb):13>
  ```
  * The same is related to `Thread`. Discussion: [Feature #16412](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16412)
  ```ruby
  p(Thread.new {})
  # Ruby 2.6:
  #   => #<Thread:0x000055be3d72fcd0@(irb):2 run>
  # Ruby 2.7:
  #   => #<Thread:0x0000561efab16560 (irb):2 run>
  ```

### `UnboundMethod#bind_call`

Binds `UnboundMethod` to a receiver and calls it. Semantically equiavalent to `unbound_method.bind(receiver).call(arguments)`, but doesn't produce intermediate `Method` object (which `bind` does).

* **Reason:** The technique of storing unbound methods and binding them later is used in some metaprogramming-heavy code to robustly use "original" implementation. For example:
  ```ruby
  MODULE_NAME = Module.instance_method(:name)

  class Customer
    def self.name
      "<Customer Model>"
    end
  end

  Customer.name # => "<Customer Model>"
  MODULE_NAME.bind_call(Customer) # => "Customer"
  ```
  In such cases (for example, code reloaders), overhead of producing new `Method` object on each `bind().call` is pretty significant, and `bind_call` allows to avoid it.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15955](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15955)
* **Documentation:** [UnboundMethod#bind_call](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/UnboundMethod.html#method-i-bind_call)

### `Module#const_source_location`

* **Discussion:** [Feature #10771](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10771)
* **Documentation:** []()
* **Code:**
* **Follow-up:**
* **Notes:**

### `Module#autoload?`: `inherit` argument

* **Reason:** More granular checking "if something is marked to be autoloaded directly or through ancestry chain" is necessary for advanced code reloaders (requested by author of the [zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk)).
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15777](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15777)
* **Documentation:** [Module#autoload?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Module.html#method-i-autoload-3F)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class Parent
    autoload :Feature1, 'feature1.rb'
  end

  module Mixin
    autoload :Feature2, 'feature2.rb'
  end

  class Child < Parent
    include Mixin
  end

  Child.autoload?(:Feature1)        # => "feature1.rb"
  Child.autoload?(:Feature1, false) # => nil
  Child.autoload?(:Feature2)        # => "feature2.rb"
  Child.autoload?(:Feature2, false) # => nil
  ```

### `Comparable#clamp` with `Range`

`Comparable#clamp` now can accept `Range` as its only argument, including beginless and endless ranges.

* **Reason:** First, ranges can be seen as more "natural" to specify _a range_ of acceptable values. Second, with introduction of beginless and endless ranges, `#clamp` now can be used for one-sided value limitation, too.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14784](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14784)
* **Documentation:** [Comparable#clamp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Comparable.html#method-i-clamp)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  123.clamp(0..100) # => 100
  -20.clamp(0..100) # => 0
  15.clamp(0..100) # => 15

  # With semi-open ranges:
  123.clamp(150..) # => 150
  123.clamp(..120) # => 120

  # Range with excluding end is not allowed
  123.clamp(0...150) # ArgumentError (cannot clamp with an exclusive range)

  # Old two-argument form still works:
  123.clamp(0, 150)
  # => 123
  ```

### `Integer[]` with range

Allows to get several bits at once.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #8842](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8842)
* **Documentation:** [Integer#[]](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Integer.html#method-i-5B-5D)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  #    4---0
  #    v   v
  0b10101001[0..4] # => 9
  0b10101001[0..4].to_s(2)
  # => "1001"
  ```

### `Complex#<=>`

`Complex#<=>(other)` now returns `nil` if the number has imaginary part, and behaves like `Numeric#<=>` if it does not.

* **Reason:** Method `#<=>` was explicitly undefined in `Complex` to underline the fact that linear order of complex numbers can't be established, but it was inconsistent with most of the other objects implementations (which return `nil` for impossible/incompatible comparison instead of rasing)
* **Discussion:** [Feature #](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/)
* **Documentation:** [Complex#<=>](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Complex.html#method-i-3C-3D-3E)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  1 + 2i <=> 1 # => nil
  1 + 2i <=> 1 + 2i # => nil, even if numbers are equal
  1 + 0i <=> 2 # => -1
  ```

### Strings, symbols and regexps

* **Unicode version:** 12.1
* **New encodigs:** [CESU-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CESU-8)

#### Core methods returning frozen strings

Several core methods now return frozen, deduplicated `String` instead of generating it every time the string is requested.

* **Reason:** Avoiding allocations of new strings for each `#to_s` of primitive objects can save dramatical amounts of memory.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #16150](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16150)
* **Affected methods:** [NilClass#to_s](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/NilClass.html#method-i-to_s), [TrueClass#to_s](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/TrueClass.html#method-i-to_s), [FalseClass#to_s](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/TrueClass.html#method-i-to_s), [Module#name](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Module.html#method-i-name)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Ruby 2.6
  true.to_s.frozen? # => false
  3.times.map { true.to_s.object_id }
  # => [47224710953060, 47224710953040, 47224710953000] -- every time new object

  # Ruby 2.7
  true.to_s.frozen? # => true
  3.times.map { true.to_s.object_id }
  # => [180, 180, 180] -- frozen special string
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Change introduces incompatibility for the code looking like:
  ```ruby
  value = true
  # ...
  buffer = value.to_s
  buffer << ' -- received'
  # Ruby 2.6: "true -- received"
  # Ruby 2.7: FrozenError (can't modify frozen String: "true")
  ```
  * The same change was proposed for `Symbol#to_s` (and could've been a dramatical improvement in some kinds of code), but the change turned out to be too disruptive.

#### `Symbol#start_with?` and `#end_with?`

* **Reason:** Symbol was once thought as "just immutable names" with any of "string-y" operations not making sense for them, but as `Symbol#match` was always present, and `Symbol#match?` [implemented in 2.4](TODO), it turns out that other content inspection methods are also useful.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #16348](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16348)
* **Documentation:** [Symbol#end_with?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0_rc1/Symbol.html#method-i-end_with-3F), [Symbol#start_with?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0_rc1/Symbol.html#method-i-start_with-3F)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  :table_name.end_with?('name', 'value')
  # => true
  :table_name.start_with?('table', 'index')
  # => true

  # Somewhat confusingly, Symbol arguments are not supported
  :table_name.end_with?(:name, 'value')
  # TypeError (no implicit conversion of Symbol into String)
  ```

### `Time`

#### `#floor` and `#ceil`

Rounds Time's nanoseconds down or up to a specified number of digits (0 by default, e.g. round to whole seconds).

* **Reason:** Rounding of nanoseconds important in a test code, when comparing `Time` instances from a different sources (stored in DB, passed through third-party libraries, etc.). Having better control on truncation comparing to `Time#round` (which existed since 1.9.2)
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15653](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15653) (floor, Japanese), [Feature #15772](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15772) (ceil)
* **Documentation:** []()
* **Code:**
* **Follow-up:**
* **Notes:**

#### `#inspect` includes subseconds

* **Reason:** Losing subseconds in `#inspect` always made debugging and testing harder, producing test failures like "Expected: 2019-12-21 16:11:08 +0200, got 2019-12-21 16:11:08 +0200" (which are visually the same, but one of them, probably going through some serialization or DB storage, has different value for subseconds).
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15958](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15958)
* **Documentation:** [Time#inspect](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Time.html#method-i-inspect)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  t = Time.now
  p t
  # Ruby 2.6: prints "2019-12-21 16:11:08 +0200"
  # Ruby 2.7: prints "2019-12-21 16:11:08.189273595 +0200"
  puts t
  # prints "2019-12-21 16:11:08 +0200"
  ```

### Enumerables and collections

#### `Enumerable#filter_map`

Transforms elements of enumerable with provided block, and drops falsy results, in one pass.

* **Reason:** Filter suitable elements, then process them somehow is a common flow of sequence processing, yet with `filter { ... }.map { ... }` additional intermediate `Array` is produced, which is not always desirable. Also, some processing can indicate "can't be processed" by returning `false` or `nil`, which requires code like `map { ... }.compact` (to drop `nil`s) or `map { ... }.select(:itself)` (to drop all falsy values).
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15323](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15323)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerable#filter_map](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Enumerable.html#method-i-filter_map)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..10).filter_map { |i| i**2 if i.even? } # => [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]

  # imagine method constantize() returning false if string can't be converted to
  # a proper constant name
  constant_names = %w[foo 123 _ bar baz/test].filter_map { |str| constantize(str) } # => ['Foo', 'Bar']

  # Without block, returns Enumerator:
  %w[foo bar baz test].filter_map
                      .with_index { |str, i| str.capitalize if i.even? }
  # => ["Foo", "Baz"]
  ```

#### `Enumerable#tally`

Counts unique objects in the enumerable and returns hash of `{object => count}`.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #11076](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11076)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerable#tally](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Enumerable.html#method-i-tally)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  %w[Ruby Python Ruby Perl Python Ruby].tally
  # => {"Ruby"=>3, "Python"=>2, "Perl"=>1}
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * `#tally` follows `#to_h` intuitions (and uses it underneath): objects are considered same if they have the same `#hash`; orders of keys corresponds to order of appearance in sequence; first object in sequence becomes the key
  * Additional block argument, or, alternatively, additional method `tally_by(&block)` was proposed in the same ticket to allow code like
  ```ruby
  (1..10).tally_by(&:even?) # => {true => 5, false => 5}
  ```
  ...but was not accepted yet.

#### `Enumerator.produce`

Produces infinite enumerator by calling provided block and passing its result to subsequent block call.

* **Reason:** `.produce` allows to convert any `while`-alike or `loop`-alike loops into enumerators, making possible to work with them in a Ruby-idiomatic `Enumerable` style.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14781](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14781)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerator.produce]()
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'date'
  # Before: while cycle to search next tuesday:
  d = Date.today
  while !d.tuesday
    d += 1
  end
  # After: enumerator:
  Enumerator.produce(Date.today, &:succ) # => enumerator of infinitely increasing dates
            .find(&:tuesday?)

  require 'strscan'
  PATTERN = %r{\d+|[-/+*]}
  scanner = StringScanner.new('7+38/6')
  # Before: while cycle to implement simple lexer:
  result =
  result << scanner.scan(PATTERN) while !scanner.eos?
  # After: achieving the same with enumerator (which can be passed to other methods to process):
  Enumerator.produce { scanner.scan(PATTERN) }.slice_after { scanner.eos? }.first
  # => ["7", "+", "38", "/", "6"]

  # Raising StopIteration allows to stop the iteration:
  ancestors = Enumerator.produce(node) { |prev| prev.parent or raise StopIteration }
  # => enumerator
  enclosing_section = ancestors.find { |n| n.type == :section } # => :section node or nil

  # If the initial value is passed, it is an argument to first block call, and yielded as a first
  # value of enumerator
  Enumerator.produce(1) { |prev| p "PREVIOUS: #{prev}"; prev + 1 }.take(3)
  # "PREVIOUS: 1"
  # "PREVIOUS: 2"
  #  => [1, 2, 3]

  # If the initial value is not passed, first block call receives `nil`, and the block's first result
  # is yielded as a first value of enumerator
  Enumerator.produce { |prev| p "PREVIOUS: #{prev.inspect}"; (prev || 0) + 1 }.take(3)
  # "PREVIOUS: nil"
  # "PREVIOUS: 1"
  # "PREVIOUS: 2"
  #  => [1, 2, 3]
  ```

#### `Enumerator::Lazy#eager`

Converts lazy enumerator back to eager one.

* **Reason:** When working with large data sequences, lazy enumerators are useful tools to not produce intermediate array on each step. But some data consuming methods expect to receive enumeratos that would really return data from methods like `take_while` and not just add them to pipeline.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15901](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15901)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerator::Lazy#eager](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Enumerator/Lazy.html#method-i-eager)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Imagine we read very large data file:
  lines =
    File.open('data.csv')
        .each_line
        .lazy
        .map { |ln| ln.sub(/\#.+$/, '').strip } # remove "comments"
        .reject(&:empty?)  # drop empty lines
  p lines
  # => #<Enumerator::Lazy: ....>

  # Now, we want to consume just "headers" from this CSV, and pass the rest of enumerator
  # into the other methods.

  # This code:
  headers = lines.take_while { |ln| ln.start_with?('$$$') }
  # ...will just produce another lazy enumerator, with `take_while` chained to pipeline.

  # Now, this:
  lines = lines.eager # makes the enumerator eager, but (unlike `#force`) doesn't consume it yet
  p lines
  # => #<Enumerator: #<Enumerator::Lazy: ...>:each>

  # consumes only several first lines and returns array of headers
  headers = lines.take_while { |ln| ln.start_with?('$$$') }
  # => [array, of, header, lines]

  # now we can pass `lines` to methods that expect take_while/take and other similar methods to
  # consume enumerator partially and return arrays
  ```

#### `Enumerator::Yielder#to_proc`

* **Reason:** When constructing the enumerator, value yielding is frequently delegated to other methods, which accept blocks. Before the change, it was inconvenient to delegate.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15618](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15618)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerator::Yielder#to_proc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Enumerator/Yielder.html#method-i-to_proc)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Construct a enumerator which will pass all lines from all files from some folder:

  # Before the change:
  all_lines = Enumerator.new { |y| # y is Yielder object here
    Dir.glob("*.rb") { |file|
      File.open(file) { |f| f.each_line { |ln| y << ln } }
    }
  }

  # After the change:
  all_lines = Enumerator.new { |y| # y is Yielder object here
    Dir.glob("*.rb") { |file|
      File.open(file) { |f| f.each_line(&y) }
    }
  }
  ```

#### `Array#intersection`

Like `Array#union` and `#difference`, [added](2.6.html#TODO) in 2.6 as a explicitly-named and accepting multiple arguments alternatives for `#|` and `#-`, the new method is alternative for `#&`.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #16155](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16155)
* **Documentation:** [Array#intersection](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Array.html#method-i-intersection)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  ['Ruby', 'Python', 'Perl'].intersection(['Ruby', 'Diamond', 'Perl'], ['Ruby', 'Nikole', 'Kate']) # => ["Ruby"]

  ['Ruby', 'Python', 'Perl'].intersection # => ["Ruby", "Python", "Perl"]
  ```

### `Fiber#raise`

Raises exception inside the resumed Fiber.

* **Reason:** Ability to raise an exception inside Fiber makes control passing abilities more feature-complete.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #10344](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10344)
* **Documentation:** [Fiber#raise](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Fiber.html#method-i-raise)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  f = Fiber.new {
    Enumerator.produce { Fiber.yield } # Infinite yielding enumerator, breaks on StopIteration
              .to_a.join(', ')
  }
  f.resume
  f.resume 1
  f.resume 2
  f.resume 3
  f.raise StopIteration # => "1, 2, 3"
  ```
* **Notes:** `Fiber#raise` has the same call sequence as `Kernel#raise` and can be called without any arguments (`RuntimeError` is empty message is raised), with string (`RuntimeError` with provided message is raised), exception class and (optional) message, or instance of the exception.

### `Range`

#### `Range#===` for `String`

In 2.6, `Range#===` was changed to use `#cover?` underneath, but not for `String`. This was fixed.

* **Discussion:** [Bug #15449](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15449)
* **Documentation:** [Range#===](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Range.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  case '2.6.5'
  when '2.4'..'2.7'
    'matches'
  else
    'nope :('
  end
  # => "nope :(" in 2.6, "matches" in 2.7
  ```

### Filesystem and IO

#### `IO#set_encoding_by_bom`

Auto-sets encoding to UTF-8 if byte-order mark is present in the stream.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #]15210(https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15210)
* **Documentation:** [IO#set_encoding_by_bom](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/IO.html#method-i-set_encoding_by_bom)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  File.write("tmp/bom.txt", "\u{FEFF}мама")
  ios = File.open("tmp/bom.txt", "rb")
  ios.binmode? # => true
  ios.external_encoding # => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>
  ios.set_encoding_by_bom # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
  ios.external_encoding # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
  ios.read # => "мама"

  File.write("tmp/nobom.txt", "мама")
  ios = File.open("tmp/nobom.txt", "rb")
  ios.set_encoding_by_bom # => nil
  ios.external_encoding # => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>
  ios.read # => "\xD0\xBC\xD0\xB0\xD0\xBC\xD0\xB0"

  # The method raises in non-binary-mode streams, or if encoding already set:
  File.open("tmp/bom.txt", "r").set_encoding_by_bom
  # ArgumentError (ASCII incompatible encoding needs binmode)
  File.open("tmp/bom.txt", "rb", encoding: 'Windows-1251').set_encoding_by_bom
  # ArgumentError (encoding is set to Windows-1251 already)
  ```

#### `Dir.glob` and `Dir.[]` not allow `\0`-separated patterns

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14643](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14643)
* **Documentation:** [Dir.glob](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/Dir.html#method-c-glob)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Dir.glob("*.rb\0*.md")
  # 2.6:
  #   warning: use glob patterns list instead of nul-separated patterns
  #   => ["2.5.md", "History.md", "README.md" ...
  # 2.7
  #   ArgumentError (nul-separated glob pattern is deprecated)

  # Proper alternative, works in 2.7 and earlier versions:
  Dir.glob(["*.rb", "*.md"])
  # => ["2.5.md", "History.md", "README.md" ...
  ```
 * File.extname now returns a dot string at a name ending with a dot.  [Bug #15267]

### Exceptions

#### `FrozenError`: receiver argument

In 2.6 several exception class constructrs [were enhanced](TODO) so the user code could create them providing context, now `FrozenError` also got this functionality.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #15751](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15751)
* **Documentation:** [FrozenError#new](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0.preview3/FrozenError.html#method-c-new)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class AlwaysFrozenHash < Hash
    # ...
    def update!(*)
      raise FrozenError.new("I am frozen!", receiver: self)
    end
  end
  ```
* **Notice:** `<Exception>.new` syntax is the only way to pass new arguments, this would **not** work:
  ```ruby
  raise FrozenError, "I am frozen!", receiver: self
  ```

### Interpreter internals

* +RubyVM.resolve_feature_path+ moved to
  <code>$LOAD_PATH.resolve_feature_path</code>.  [Feature #15903] [Feature #15230]

#### `GC.compact`

* Added GC.compact method for compacting the heap.
  This function compacts live objects in the heap so that fewer pages may
  be used, and the heap may be more CoW friendly. [Feature #15626]
  TODO https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16443

* ObjectSpace::WeakMap#[]= now accepts special objects as either key or
  values.  [Feature #16035]

## Standard library

  * Date.jisx0301, Date#jisx0301, and Date.parse support the new Japanese
    era.  [Feature #15742]
  * Object#DelegateClass accepts a block and module_evals it in the context
    of the returned class, similar to Class.new and Struct.new.

IRB::

  * Introduce syntax highlight inspired by pry.gem to Binding#irb source lines,
    REPL input, and inspect output of some core-class objects.

  * Introduce multiline mode by Reline.

  * Show documents when completion.

  * Enable auto indent and save/load history by default.
Reline::

  * New stdlib that is compatible with readline stdlib by pure Ruby and also
    has a multiline mode.

* Net::HTTP Add ipaddr optional parameter to Net::HTTP#start to replace the address for
    TCP/IP connection [Feature #5180]
* Add Net::FTP#features to check available features, and Net::FTP#option to
  enable/disable each of them.  [Feature #15964]
* Net::IMAP:: Add Server Name Indication (SNI) support.  [Feature #15594]

open-uri::
  * Warn open-uri's "open" method at Kernel.
    Use URI.open instead.  [Misc #15893]
  * The default charset of text/* media type is UTF-8 instead of
    ISO-8859-1.  [Bug #15933]

Pathname::
  * Delegates 3 arguments from Pathname.glob to Dir.glob to
    accept base: keyword.
  * Kernel#Pathname when called with a Pathname argument now returns
    the argument instead of creating a new Pathname. This is more
    similar to other Kernel methods, but can break code that modifies
    the return value and expects the argument not to be modified.

OptionParser::
  * Now show "Did you mean?" for unknown option.  [Feature #16256]
